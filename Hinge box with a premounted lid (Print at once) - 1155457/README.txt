Summary:
Update3 70x120x20 dimension version added.  put extra support for the hinges in this version right in the middle of the lid because it is so tall.Update2 70x100x25 dimension version added.Update1 89x170x30 dimension version added. I put extra support for the hinges in this version right in the middle of the lid because it is so tall.This is a hinged box with a premounted cover.This product is a single piece and its hinge is ready to rotate. No screws, glue, magnet or nails are required.Useful for keeping small stuff like needle, button, secrew, pills or something like these.There is no need to get parts together after print. It designed as a solid piece.You can see that there is opposing covs and rims on both sides over the hinge area.The lid was separate from the box but has to be print at once. It has a opening/closing function due to pre designed hinged part.I've made it completely stable. This is why I deleted previous uploads. If required, I can upload whatever dimesnsions you need.37x45x15Outer dimensions: W: 37mm  L: 45mm  H: 15mmInner dimension: W: 31mm  L: 28mm  H: 12mm55x110x15Outer dimensions: W: 55mm  L: 110mm  H: 15mmInner dimension: W: 49mm  L: 103mm  H: 12mm55x110x25Outer dimensions: W: 55mm  L: 110mm  H: 25mmInner dimension: W: 49mm  L: 103mm  H: 22mm70x100x25Outer dimensions: W: 70mm  L: 100mm  H: 25mmInner dimension: W: 64mm  L: 94mm  H: 22mm70x120x20Outer dimensions: W: 70mm  L: 120mm  H: 20mmInner dimension: W: 64mm  L: 114mm  H: 17mm89x170x30Outer dimensions: W: 89mm  L: 170mm  H: 30mmInner dimension: W: 83mm  L: 164mm  H: 24mmPlease use support.
